# ðŸ§© Customer Segmentation & Behavior Analysis

This project implements an **end-to-end customer segmentation pipeline** using **Snowflake**, **dbt**, and **Python (KMeans clustering)**.  
It transforms raw online retail transactions into clean, feature-engineered datasets and then groups customers based on purchasing behavior.


## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal was to identify and understand customer purchasing behavior by analyzing how recently, how often, and how much customers spend.  
Using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** metrics and **KMeans clustering**, customers were categorized into segments such as *Champions*, *Potential Loyalists*, and *At-Risk*.

### âœ… Workflow Summary
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation (dbt)**
   - Loaded raw data into Snowflake.
   - Created a staging model (`stg_online_retail.sql`) to clean and format data â€” removing nulls, filtering cancellations, and converting timestamps.
2. **Feature Engineering (RFM Calculation)**
   - Built a dbt model (`fct_rfm.sql`) to compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary metrics for each customer.
3. **Scoring & Segmentation**
   - Assigned R, F, M scores (1â€“5) in dbt.
   - Combined scores into an `rfm_code` to derive segments such as *Champions*, *Loyal*, and *Potential*.
4. **KMeans Clustering (Python)**
   - Connected Python to Snowflake using `snowflake-connector-python`.
   - Pulled RFM metrics from `CUSTOMER_ANALYTICS.MARTS.FCT_RFM`.
   - Applied **KMeans clustering** to form 3 customer groups based on RFM similarity.
   - Wrote results back to Snowflake as `CUSTOMER_CLUSTERS`.
5. **Behavioral Insights**
   - Calculated average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values by cluster.
   - Interpreted segments:
     - **Cluster 0** â†’ High Frequency & Spending = Champions  
     - **Cluster 1** â†’ Low Frequency & Low Spending = At-Risk  
     - **Cluster 2** â†’ Moderate Frequency & Spending = Potential Loyalists



## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

| Layer | Tool / Library |

| Data Warehouse | **Snowflake** |
| Data Transformation | **dbt-core**, **dbt-snowflake** |
| Modeling / ML | **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn** |

## ðŸ“Š Results & Behavioral Insights

After applying KMeans clustering on RFM features, three distinct customer segments were identified:

| Cluster                     | Description                                                          | Recency (Days) | Frequency | Monetary ($) | Key Insight                                                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0 â€“ Champions**           | Most engaged customers with frequent purchases and high spending     | ~5000          | 11.7      | 7,148        | Drive retention through loyalty programs and exclusive offers |
| **1 â€“ At-Risk / Dormant**   | Infrequent and low-spending customers who havenâ€™t purchased recently | ~5254          | 1.5       | 407          | Reactivate via personalized discounts or re-engagement emails |
| **2 â€“ Potential Loyalists** | Moderate buyers who show potential to become repeat customers        | ~5054          | 2.5       | 738          | Target with upselling and retention campaigns                 |


## ðŸ§  Interpretation:

Cluster 0 represents top 10â€“15% of customers but contributes over 60% of total revenue â€” they should be prioritized for VIP programs.

Cluster 1 shows churn risk â€” a win-back campaign could re-engage them.

Cluster 2 contains growth potential â€” personalized recommendations can nurture them into loyal customers.

## ðŸ“ˆ Business Takeaways:

**Retention > Acquisition:** Focus marketing budget on maintaining loyalty among existing high-value customers.

**Personalization:** Tailor promotions and communication frequency by segment.

**Product Feedback Loop:** Analyze purchase categories of Cluster 0 vs Cluster 1 to guide future product strategy.
